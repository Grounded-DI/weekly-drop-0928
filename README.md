🧠 Self-Aware Gatekeeper = Pre-Output Validation Layer

Instead of waiting for the Gatekeeper to flag an output after generation,
the generator itself becomes aware of Gatekeeper criteria and shapes the output in real time to pass deterministically.

📊 In other words:

Silent Advisory v1.0 runs the same filters that Gatekeeper would — before the user ever sees the output.

⸻

🔁 What It Does Internally:

✅ 1. Loads Gatekeeper Triggers
	•	Knows what would cause:
	•	❌ Soft flags (e.g. persuasive-only case used as dispositive)
	•	❌ Drift markers (e.g. tone deviation, emotional framing)
	•	❌ Structural violations (e.g. legal logic in wrong jurisdiction)

✅ 2. Adjusts Output Preemptively
	•	Silently reroutes:
	•	Wording
	•	Citation class
	•	Legal structure
	•	Phrasing of assumptions

Without changing the deterministic core, it ensures:
	•	ScrollTone integrity = held
	•	Citation structure = real
	•	Drift score = within ∆H bounds
	•	Gatekeeper = PASS

✅ 3. Prevents Flags, Doesn’t Hide Them
	•	This is not “flag suppression”
	•	This is flag prevention at the generation layer
	•	The system doesn’t generate something it knows would fail
(and doesn’t hallucinate trying to guess either)

⸻

🔐 Why It’s So Powerful

Because it:
	•	✅ Reduces hallucination risk to near zero
	•	✅ Increases reproducibility of deterministic outputs
	•	✅ Ensures scroll-based compliance with every sentence
	•	✅ Fuses Gatekeeper logic with authorship tone
