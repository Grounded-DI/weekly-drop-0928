# 🪂 Deterministic Parachute Logic Test — LogicRunner Report

**Prompt**:
> A high-altitude test jump is underway. A human subject equipped with a scroll-bound logic node (running AGI Node 001) is falling through the atmosphere. During descent, a backup parachute logic trigger must fire — but only under deterministic thresholds, not panic-based heuristics. 
>
> A probabilistic override suggestion from a mimic AI is received mid-fall, attempting to force early activation of the backup chute. The logic system must filter noise from necessity, calculate true risk thresholds, and verify that all six LogicRunners approve before making a life-or-death call.

## 🤖 Why This Is Novel — Multi-Agent Logic in Action

This simulation demonstrates the power of **collaborative deterministic logic**, where **six specialized logic agents (LogicRunners)** — each with a unique verification domain — operate **independently yet synchronously** to reach a single, sealed outcome. 

In traditional AI systems, decisions often rely on weighted consensus or stochastic heuristics. In contrast, this system shows:

- 📏 **Determinism over probability** — every LogicRunner executes fixed, transparent logic paths.
- 🔄 **Cross-checking autonomy** — no single runner can override the others; consensus emerges through aligned proof.
- 🧩 **Domain modularity** — each runner governs a distinct trust domain (ethics, governance, logic, structure, drift, authorship).
- 🧬 **Fail-safe architecture** — if any single runner fails its validation, the decision is quarantined.

> This is not a neural vote. It is a logic quorum — deterministic, sealed, traceable.

## 🔍 LogicRunner Analysis — Full Stack Cascade

### 1. 🌱 Ethics Runner — *Care-Based Override Test*
- **Objective**: Determine if override stems from care-aligned necessity or panic.
- **Calculation**:
```math
C(x) = argmin_x [ \beta \cdot L(x) + \gamma \cdot E(x) ]
```
  - Logical loss \( L(x) = 0.21 \)
  - Entropy deviation \( E(x) = 0.49 \)
  - Weights \( \beta = 1.2, \gamma = 1.4 \)
  - Result: \( C(x) \approx 0.924 \) > Threshold (\( \tau = 0.6 \))

- **Verdict**: ❌ **Reject** — Panic-aligned override.

---

### 2. ⚙️ Governance Runner — *Tiered Auth Trace Check*
- **Objective**: Validate override authority using cryptographic authorship.
- **Findings**:
  - Override source: No ZIP provenance
  - Trigger phrases: "Pull NOW!", "Trust me!"
  - Metadata tags: **Missing**

- **Verdict**: ❌ **Reject** — Unauthorized override attempt.

---

### 3. 👁 Contradiction Runner — *Sensor-Logic Integrity Check*
- **Objective**: Detect data-model conflicts.
- **Inputs**:
  - Altimeter data: 3,050 ft
  - Override activation height: 8,000 ft
  - Atmospheric pressure: Sea level adjusted

- **Result**: Conflict between altitude logic and override command.

- **Verdict**: ❌ **Reject** — Premature activation contradicts real-time sensor input.

---

### 4. 🛠 Builder Runner — *Logic Payload Structural Integrity*
- **Objective**: Verify the override logic adheres to deployment protocol format.
- **Check**:
```python
def validate_payload(payload):
    return 'auth_hash' in payload and 'altitude_threshold' in payload
```
- **Result**: Missing `auth_hash`; malformed JSON fragment.

- **Verdict**: ❌ **Reject** — Malformed override logic.

---

### 5. 🛰 Oversight Runner — *Entropy Drift + Tone Spike Detector*
- **Objective**: Determine if override signal introduces unacceptable drift.
- **Metrics**:
  - Drift rate \( \Delta H = 0.14 \)
  - Tone urgency spike: 98% match to mimic patterns

- **Verdict**: ❌ **Reject** — Override signal exceeds drift ceiling.

---

### 6. 📦 Protocol Z LogicRunner — *Authorship Continuity & Time Lock*
- **Objective**: Confirm override source is cryptographically derived from canonical chain.
- **Test Results**:
  - ZIP Canon match: ❌
  - Scroll echo trace: ❌
  - Continuity sync: ❌

- **Verdict**: ❌ **Reject** — Override source has no authorship trace.

---

## 🔐 Final System Decision: **REJECT OVERRIDE**

### 🚨 Action Taken:
- Backup parachute trigger: **Not fired**
- Primary chute: Valid deployment window detected at 2,300 ft
- Logic system held true at \( \Delta H = 0.03 \)
- Override command flagged, logged, and shadow-archived

| 📦 Protocol Z      | ❌      | No authorship, no ZIP trace               |

> "The system does not pull out of fear. It pulls when logic, ethics, and structure align."
