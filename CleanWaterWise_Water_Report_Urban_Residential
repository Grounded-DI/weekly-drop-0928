## 📍 Simulation Region

**ZIP 02130 – Jamaica Plain, Boston, MA**  
Urban residential/mixed-use zone near ponds, aging infrastructure, and legacy utilities. Not coastal. Fed by MWRA.

---

## 1. 🎯 Water Risk Gauge

```
🔴  🟠  🟡  🟢
    ↑
 Moderate Risk
```

Risk due to pre-1986 laterals, aging filtration, and urban runoff. PFAS unconfirmed but flagged.

---

## 2. 🧪 Simulated Contaminant Profile

| Contaminant | Index Score | Trigger Basis |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Lead (Pb)** | 64/100 | Pre-1986 laterals (partial replacements) |
| **PFAS** | 41/100 | No confirmed hits; adjacent grid detection |
| **Nanoparticles** | 57/100 | Urban runoff + storm drain zones |
| **Microplastics** | 52/100 | Aging catchments, stormwater spread |
| **Nitrates** | 20/100 | Not agriculturally active |

---

## 3. 🏗️ Infrastructure & Land Use Notes

- Water Source: MWRA (Quabbin + Wachusett)  
- Pb Risk: Line replacements incomplete at residential scale  
- Filtration: Primary safe; distribution = residual risk

---

## 4. 🏫 Sensitive Facility Zones

- Schools & child care centers intersect legacy Pb zones  
- Elder care facilities in nanoparticle-adjacent grid sectors

---

## 5. 📅 Violation Timeline

```
|■■■■■■■■■■■| → 0 years since last correction
```

2024 MA DEP action → required BWSC and MWRA systems to disclose Pb mapping and notify residents.

---

## ☣️ Toxicity Dial

```
      🔴 High
    🟠   ← 02130
  🟡
🟢 Low
```

Main trigger: Lead + nanoparticle compounding under Scroll 91 ethics override.

## ✅ Certainty Breakdown

| Component            | Subscore | Notes |
|----------------------|----------|-------|
| Infrastructure Certainty | 85 | MWRA + housing record match |
| Sampling Confirmation    | 60 | PFAS unconfirmed; Pb mapped |
| Nano/Micro Fit           | 70 | Pond/drainage overlays match |
| Violation History        | 80 | MWRA compliant; local variance remains |
