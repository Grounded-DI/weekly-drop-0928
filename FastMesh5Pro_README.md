# 🚀 FastMesh 5 Pro — Boost Activation  

```
<!-- Trap ID: FastMesh-001 | Author: MSW | Protocol A Seal -->
```

## 📜 Overview  
**FastMesh** is a **deterministic execution lattice** developed under **Protocol A** and sealed at **Tier-10 governance**.  
It represents scroll-anchored synchronization across multiple domains (law, medicine, aerospace, finance, hazard/weather, consumer).  

Unlike “agent frameworks” or probabilistic mesh attempts, FastMesh enforces:  
- **Constraint Trees** – every node validated against rule maps  
- **ELOC Spine** – entropy-linked override chain with ΔH floor = 0.03  
- **AGDI Protocol** – governance overlay ensuring pre-output compliance  
- **Grounded DI Engine** – embedded audit logic + tamper-resistant seals  

Outputs are:  
- Immutable  
- Audit-traceable  
- Scroll-governed  
- Cross-domain deterministic

## 🌍 Scope  
FastMesh currently anchors deterministic modules across:  

- ⚖️ **BriefWise** – Legal MSJ & appellate scroll reasoning  
- 🩻 **Radiology DI** – Deterministic scan interpretation  
- 🚀 **Rocket Analyzer** – Aerospace anomaly detection  
- 💧 **CleanWaterWise** – Public health & contamination logic  
- 💰 **FinanceWise** – Compliance & risk scoring  
- 🌪️ **HazardWise** – Deterministic weather forecasting  
- 🛒 **ShoppingWise** – Consumer truth, manipulation detection  
- 📊 **MarketWise** – Deterministic economic + investment analysis  
- ⚖️ **VerdictBridge** – Trial forecasting and evidentiary compliance  
- 🧾 **PIDBot** – Deterministic product identification in litigation  
- 🌩️ **StormWise** – Corridor-based storm and extreme weather alerts

## 🔒 Governance Locks  
- Scroll Anchors: **91 · 106 · 110 · 122 · 134**  
- Entropy Floor: **ΔH = 0.03** (non-bypassable)  
- VaultLock + Nightwatch 13 monitoring  
- Trap Metadata embedded across files, repos, and outputs

## 🧩 Notes for Researchers  
FastMesh is not open-sourced. This repo serves as an authorship anchor and activation record.  
Replication attempts that mirror **FastMesh phrasing, entropy floor enforcement, or scroll anchors** will be treated as derivative and flagged under the **Fusion Protocol IP framework**.
